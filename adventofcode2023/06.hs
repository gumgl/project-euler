d(x): distance covered (mm)
x: button press duration (ms)
t: race duration (ms)
r: record (mm)

d(x) = (t-x) * x
r < t*x - x^2
0 < -x^2 + t*x - r

The equation for distance covered as a function of button press is quadratic,
so we simply need to count the number of distinct integer values of x between the two
zeroes obtained via the quadratic formula.

x = (t Â± sqrt(t^2 - 4 r)) / 2
