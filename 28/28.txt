Another one that can be solved with paper and a calculator!

The first obvious solution would be to build the 2D spiral and sum the diagonals.

Then you could save some writes and iterations by only filling in the diagonals,
skipping to the next diagonal position as you build the spiral.

But in order to do so, you must see the pattern in the skips, and therefore in
the numbers that go into the diagonals. In fact we don't need a 2D data structure,
we are only interested in summing the list of numbers going into the (merged) diagonals.

With such pattern in hand, you can write the summation in mathematical form:

(sum (1+(i-1)*2)^2 * 4 + i*20,i=1..n) + 1
where n = floor(spiral_size/2) (in this case n=500)

You can then obtain the closed form with some algebra: 2/3 n (8 n^2 + 15 n + 13)
